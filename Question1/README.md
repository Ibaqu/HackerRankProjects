# Grading Students

Grades are between 0 and 100
Any grade less than a 40 is a failing grade

If difference between grade and the next mutliple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs since the result will still be a failing grade.
